Paywall Slayer
==============

### The Ultimate Adblock Plus List for Bypassing Paywalls ###

A comprehensive Adblock Plus compatible filter list for getting around paywalls.
While some paywalls are implemented at the server level, and cannot be easily bypassed, many
simply rely on frontend scripts, and ovelays to block access.  This filter list attempts to
block as many of these as possible.

How to Use
----------

First off, you're going to need an adblocking extension which supports third party filter lists.  I recommend uBlock for Chrome users, and Adblock Plus for Firefox users.

### Adblock Plus ###
Just use this link [abp:subscribe?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FThoolooExpress%2Fpaywall-slayer%2Fmaster%2Fpaywall-slayer.txt&title=Paywall%20Slayer]

### uBlock ###
Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThoolooExpress/paywall-slayer/master/paywall-slayer.txt`
into the Costom box at the bottom of the settings page.
